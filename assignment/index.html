    <ul>
        <li>In my spare time I love to enjoy the outdoors, whether that is going on hikes in the woods or going fishing.</li>
        <li>I love to listen to music, I own several guitars. One acoustic and two electric guitars. Some of my favorite bands include Led Zepplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Queen. A new band I've been enjoying is called the Marcus King Band. I highly recommend them. </li>
        <li>Finally, I love Technology! I love to hear the about the lastest piece of tech, whether that is Tesla or SpaceX news or maybe the Newest Smartphone or Tablet that is rumored to have some fancy features.</li>
